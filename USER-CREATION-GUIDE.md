### Step 2: Access User Management

3. Click on **"User Management"**

### Step 3: Create a New User
1. Click the **"Create New User"** button (top right)

     - 👤 **User** - Regular access (can send campaigns)
     - 👑 **Admin** - Full access (can manage users + send campaigns)
3. Click **"Create User"**
4. Done! ✅

### Step 4: View All Users
The User Management section shows a table with:

## 📋 User Creation Checklist

When creating a new user through the UI:
- [ ] Enter valid email address
- [ ] Create strong temporary password
- [ ] Set appropriate role (User or Admin)
- [ ] Click "Create User"
- [ ] Wait for success notification
- [ ] Share email and password with the new user
- [ ] Tell them to change password after first login

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Passwords
- Automatically hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Never stored in plain text
- Users should change default password after first login

### Roles
- **Admin:** Can create users, manage campaigns, access all features
- **User:** Can send campaigns, manage recipients/senders/templates

### Active Status
- Inactive users cannot login
- Use this instead of deleting users (preserves history)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Default Password Pattern**: Use something memorable like:
   - `Welcome@2025`
   - `Change@FirstLogin`
   - `Temp@Password123`

2. **Role Selection**: 
   - Give Admin only to trusted team members
   - Most users should be regular "User" role

3. **Email Format**:
   - Must be valid email format
   - System will validate automatically

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create user"
- Check if email already exists
- Ensure all fields are filled
- Check network connection

### "Access Denied"
- Only admins can access User Management
- Regular users won't see this section in sidebar

### User Management not showing in sidebar
- Verify you're logged in as admin
- Check your role in the header (should show admin badge)

## 📊 Current Users in System

You currently have 2 users:
1. **admin@example.com** - Admin (default account)
2. **ashanlokuge10@gmail.com** - Admin (your account)
