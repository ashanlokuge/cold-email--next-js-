# Subject Line Personalization Fix

## Issue
Subject lines were not being personalized - variables like `{{firstName}}` remained as-is instead of being replaced with actual values.

**Example:**
- ❌ **Before:** Subject shows "Hi {{firstName}} this is updated task"
- ✅ **After:** Subject shows "Hi Ashan this is updated task"

## Root Cause
In `src/pages/api/campaigns/send.ts` (line 494), the subject was being used directly without personalization:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (Wrong)
const personalizedText = personalizeContent(text, recipient, i, sender);

const emailMessage = {
  senderAddress: sender,
  content: {
    subject: subject,  // ← NOT PERSONALIZED!
    plainText: personalizedText,
  }
}
```

## Fix Applied
Added personalization for the subject line:

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (Correct)
const personalizedSubject = personalizeContent(subject, recipient, i, sender);
const personalizedText = personalizeContent(text, recipient, i, sender);

const emailMessage = {
  senderAddress: sender,
  content: {
    subject: personalizedSubject,  // ← NOW PERSONALIZED!
    plainText: personalizedText,
  }
}
```

## What Gets Personalized in Subject

All the same variables that work in the body now work in the subject:

### Variables
- `{{firstName}}` → "Ashan"
- `{{name}}` → "Ashan Lokuge"
- `{{email}}` → "ashan@example.com"
- `{{sender}}` → "noreply@digiquarter.com"
- `{{index}}` → "1" (email number)

### Spintax
- `{Hi|Hello|Hey}` → Randomly picks one
- `{Quick|Fast|Rapid} question` → "Quick question" (or Fast/Rapid)

### Example Subjects

**Template:**
```
{Hi|Hello} {{firstName}}, {quick|important} update for you
```

**Results for different recipients:**
```
Recipient 1: "Hi Ashan, quick update for you"
Recipient 2: "Hello John, important update for you"
Recipient 3: "Hi Sarah, quick update for you"
```

## Testing

### Before the fix:
```
Subject: "Hi {{firstName}} this is updated task"
Body: "Hi Ashan this is updated task"
```

### After the fix:
```
Subject: "Hi Ashan this is updated task"
Body: "Hi Ashan this is updated task"
```

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/api/campaigns/send.ts` (line 488-489)

## Verification
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Subject line now uses `personalizeContent()`
✅ All variable replacements work in subject
✅ Spintax expansion works in subject
✅ Consistent with body personalization
