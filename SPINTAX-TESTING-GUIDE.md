## üî¨ Advanced Spintax Techniques

### Nested Spintax (Currently Supported)
```
{Hi|Hello} {{firstName}}, {I wanted to {reach out|contact you}|{Here's|This is} something {cool|amazing}}
```

### Multiple Variations in One Sentence
```
{I {really|truly} {think|believe}|My {opinion|view} is that|I {feel|sense}} this {could|would|will} {help|benefit|assist} you.
```

**Possible outputs:**
- "I really think this could help you."
- "I truly believe this would benefit you."
- "My opinion is that this will assist you."
- "I feel this could help you."
- etc...

---

## üé≤ How Randomization Works

### Seeded Random (Consistent Per Recipient)
```typescript
// Each recipient gets the SAME variation every time
// Seed = hash(email + index + content)

Ashan (ashan@example.com) ‚Üí Always gets variation #2
Sarah (sarah@company.com) ‚Üí Always gets variation #1
Mike (mike@startup.com) ‚Üí Always gets variation #3
```

### Why This Matters
‚úÖ **Consistency**: Same recipient always sees same version
‚úÖ **Uniqueness**: Different recipients see different versions
‚úÖ **Natural**: Looks like you manually wrote each one

---

2. ‚úÖ **Multiple alternatives**: `{one|two|three|four|five}`
3. ‚úÖ **Nested spintax**: `{I {really|truly} believe|My view is}`
4. ‚úÖ **Combined with variables**: `{Hi|Hello} {{firstName}}`

---

## üéØ Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Use 2-4 alternatives per spintax (more = better uniqueness)
‚úÖ Keep alternatives similar in tone and length
‚úÖ Test with at least 3 recipients to see variations
‚úÖ Combine spintax with {{variables}} for maximum personalization

### DON'T:
‚ùå Use too few alternatives (defeats the purpose)
‚ùå Make alternatives drastically different in meaning
‚ùå Forget to test before sending to real prospects
‚ùå Overuse spintax (makes content hard to read)

---

## üöÄ Ready to Test!

Use the test template above and send to yourself with 3 different email addresses to see the variations in action!

**Status:** ‚úÖ Spintax is 100% working perfectly!
